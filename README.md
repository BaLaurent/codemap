# 🏨 CodeMap Hotel

**Watch your AI coding agents come to life!** See Claude Code and Cursor as pixel-art characters moving through a hotel, working at desks, reading files, and writing code in real-time.

## 🛠 Alternative Setup

### Clone and Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamsusMaximus/codemap
cd codemap
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173/hotel

### Setup Hooks Only (no server start)

```bash
npx github:JamsusMaximus/codemap setup
```

## 📖 How It Works

```
🤖 AI Agent      →  📡 Hooks      →  🖥 Server      →  🎨 Browser
(Claude/Cursor)     (capture)       (broadcast)       (render)
```

1. Your AI agent reads/writes files or runs commands
2. Hook scripts capture these events
3. Server tracks activity and broadcasts via WebSocket
4. Browser renders the pixel-art hotel in real-time
